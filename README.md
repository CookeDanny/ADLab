# ADLab
Heavily borrowed from Clong/DetectionLab - stripped out all the WEF and logging stuff. Just a simple DC and 2 Windows 10 boxes for an AD/Powershell Lab.

Learned Vagrant :)

Add a "Boxes" folder at the root and add some images. Personally, I used the ready made boxes linked in the Detection Lab repo

From cold - the lab was ready in roughly 30 mins on a 4th Gen i5 and an SSD for boxes and VM's
